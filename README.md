# transfer-learning-in-chaotic-systems

This project is used to investigate the application of transfer learning techniques in chaotic systems, with the key questions to be explore including: 1) can transfer learning be achieved between different chaotic systems? 2) what is the necessary conditions for transfer learning in chaotic systems? 3) what can be transferred and what can not be transferred? 4) can transfer learning be achieved in spatiotemporal chaotic systems and complex nonlinear systems in general? 5) what is the potential application of transfer learning of chaotic systems in engineering, biology, and brain science?
